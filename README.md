# cybersecurity
my first  repository
My name is Mucyo Patrick, and I am a cybersecurity analyst. I began my journey at Cisco Networking Academy in 2023, and after five months, I had the opportunity to study cybersecurity at Coursera. It was an amazing journey, and I enjoyed every project, task, or piece of work that cybersecurity analysts do. "I got an internship at the Africa Cybersecurity Consortium, and I am currently working there as a volunteer.
